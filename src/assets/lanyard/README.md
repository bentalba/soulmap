# Lanyard Assets

## Required Files

You need to add these files to this directory:

1. **card.glb** - The 3D model for the ID card
   - Download from the react-bits repository or create your own
   - Can be edited at: https://modelviewer.dev/editor/
   - Customize the texture to match Yusra's brand (cosmic theme)

2. **lanyard.png** - The texture for the lanyard band
   - Should match the cosmic color scheme (#D4AF37 gold, cosmic purple, etc.)
   - Recommended size: 512x512px or similar
   - Pattern will repeat along the band

## Customization Tips

### For card.glb:
- Add Yusra's name and title
- Include "Maritime Navigation" and "Astrology Master's Student"
- Use cosmic gold (#D4AF37) and purple (#9B4DCA) colors
- Add star/celestial symbols

### For lanyard.png:
- Create a repeating pattern with stars or cosmic elements
- Use the brand colors: gold, purple, navy
- Keep it subtle to not overpower the card

## Current Status

⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER FILES NEEDED**: Please add the actual .glb and .png files to this directory.

For development, the component will use fallback paths. Update the imports in the Lanyard.tsx component once you add the files.
